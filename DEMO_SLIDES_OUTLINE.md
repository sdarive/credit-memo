## Slide 2: The Problem

**Visual:** Split screen or "Before" scenario

```
THE PROBLEM

Credit Analysts Today:
• 4-6 hours per loan on manual work
• Copy-paste from old memos
• Extract data from PDFs by hand
• Calculate ratios in Excel
• Write narratives from scratch

Result: Bottlenecks & delays
```

**Speaker Notes:** "Credit analysts waste hours on repetitive work instead of analysis."

## Slide 3: The Solution

**Visual:** "After" scenario with Ernie

**Text:**
```
THE SOLUTION: ERNIE

Automate the Heavy Lifting:
✓ LandingAI ADE extracts financial data
✓ Multi-agent analysis (9 credit ratios)
✓ AWS Bedrock generates memos with RAG
✓ Analyst reviews & approves

Result: 4-6 hours → 30 minutes
```

**Speaker Notes:** "Ernie automates data entry, analysts focus on judgment."

## Design Tips

**Color Scheme:**
- Primary: Banking green (#006747)
- Secondary: Dark gray (#333333)
- Accent: Orange (AWS) #FF9900, Purple (LandingAI) #667eea
- Background: White or light gray

**Fonts:**
- Headers: Bold, sans-serif (Arial, Helvetica)
- Body: Regular sans-serif
- Code/Technical: Monospace (Courier, Consolas)

**Layout:**
- Keep text minimal (5-7 bullets max per slide)
- Use screenshots liberally (show, don't tell)
- High contrast for readability
- Large fonts (24pt+ for body text)

---

## When to Use Slides

**Use slides if:**
- Live demo might fail
- Poor internet connection
- Want visual backup
- Nervous about live demo
- Conference room setup unknown

**Skip slides if:**
- Live demo works reliably
- Want to look more technical
- Time is limited
- Prefer spontaneous feel

---

## Slide Deck Strategy

**Option 1: Full Slide Deck**
- 12 slides as outlined above
- Use for safety/backup
- Can present without live demo if needed

**Option 2: Hybrid (Recommended)**
- 3-4 intro slides (Problem, Solution, Architecture)
- Switch to live demo
- 2-3 closing slides (Impact, Pilot Plan, Thank You)

**Option 3: Live Demo Only**
- No slides, just screen share
- More engaging but riskier
- Have screenshots as emergency backup

---

## Tools for Creating Slides

**Quick & Easy:**
- Google Slides (free, browser-based)
- PowerPoint (if you have Office)
- Keynote (Mac only)

**Design Tools:**
- Canva (free templates)
- Figma (for custom designs)

**Time Estimate:**
- Basic slides: 1-2 hours
- Polished slides: 3-4 hours

---

**RECOMMENDATION:**

For a hackathon demo, I'd suggest **Option 2 (Hybrid)**:
1. Start with 2-3 slides to set context
2. Switch to live demo (the impressive part!)
3. Close with 1-2 impact slides

This gives you safety (slides as backup) while showcasing the working product (live demo).

But if your live demo works well, **Option 3 (Live Demo Only)** is most impressive!
