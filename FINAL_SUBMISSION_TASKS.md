```

### Step 1.5: Verify Push Succeeded
Visit your GitHub repository in browser and confirm latest commit appears.

**✓ Checkpoint:** All changes committed and pushed to GitHub

---

## ✅ Task 2: Manual End-to-End Testing (30-45 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Start Backend Server

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
cd /Users/sivad/projects/credit-memo/backend
python3 app.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ AWS Bedrock client initialized in region: us-east-1
✓ Flask backend running on http://0.0.0.0:5001
```

**If you see errors:** That's OK, note them for later. Backend should still start.

### Step 2.2: Verify Backend Health

**Terminal 2 (new):**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "ade_configured": true,
  "bedrock_configured": true/false,
  "rag_knowledge_base": true/false
}
```

**✓ Checkpoint:** Backend is running and responding

### Step 2.3: Start Frontend Server

**Terminal 3 (new):**
```bash
cd /Users/sivad/projects/credit-memo/frontend
npm start
```

**Expected:** Browser opens automatically at http://localhost:3000

**What you should see:**
- Bank header with "MIDWEST REGIONAL BANK" and "Member FDIC"
- "Ernie" title with LandingAI and AWS Bedrock logos
- Dark background behind Ernie title
- Upload interface with drag-and-drop area

**✓ Checkpoint:** Frontend loads with new Ernie branding

### Step 2.4: Test with "Test Data" Button (Bypass API Credits)

1. In browser at http://localhost:3000
2. Click **"Use Test Data"** button (no file upload needed)
3. Watch progress bar go through stages:
   - Loading test data...
   - Analyzing financial metrics...
   - Calculating risk ratios...
   - Generating AI credit memo with AWS Bedrock...
   - Finalizing credit memo (30-40 seconds)...

**Expected:** After ~40 seconds, you should see:
- ✅ Results dashboard with financial metrics
- ✅ 9 financial ratios with color indicators (green/yellow/red)
- ✅ Credit memo with bank letterhead:
  ```
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════
  MIDWEST REGIONAL BANK
  Business & Commercial Finance
  Member FDIC
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════

  CREDIT MEMORANDUM
  ```

**If it fails:** Check Terminal 1 for backend errors. Common issues:
- AWS Bedrock not configured → Uses mock memo (that's OK!)
- Timeout → Increase timeout or check backend logs

**✓ Checkpoint:** Test data flow works end-to-end

### Step 2.5: Test Memo Editing

1. Scroll to the memo section
2. Click **"Edit Memo"** button
3. Make a change in the text area (add a word, change punctuation)
4. Click **"Save Changes"**
5. Verify your edit appears in the rendered memo

**✓ Checkpoint:** Memo editing works

### Step 2.6: Test Download Functionality

1. Click **"Download Memo (Text)"**
   - Should download a .txt file with bank letterhead
2. Click **"Download as Word"**
   - Should download a .docx file
3. Open the Word file and verify:
   - Bank header with "MIDWEST REGIONAL BANK"
   - "Business & Commercial Finance"
   - "Member FDIC"
   - Footer with "Generated by Ernie"

**✓ Checkpoint:** Download works for both formats

### Step 2.7: Test with Real Document (Optional but Recommended)

1. Click **"← New Analysis"** to reset
2. Navigate to: `/Users/sivad/projects/credit-memo/datasets/SBA_Loan_Applications_Realistic/rustic_brew_coffee_house`
3. Select one of the PDF files
4. Enter borrower info:
   - Company Name: Rustic Brew Coffee House
   - Industry: Restaurant
5. Click **"Analyze Documents"**

**Expected:** Same workflow as test data, but using LandingAI ADE

**If you get 402 error (credits exhausted):** That's expected. Use "Test Data" button instead for demo.

**✓ Checkpoint:** Real document upload tested (or know to use Test Data for demo)

### Step 2.8: Test Error Handling

1. **Invalid File Type:**
   - Try uploading a .txt or .png file
   - Expected: Error message "file is not supported"

2. **No Files Selected:**
   - Click "Analyze Documents" without selecting files
   - Expected: Error message "Please select at least one file"

**✓ Checkpoint:** Error handling works properly

### Step 2.9: Document Test Results

**Create a quick note:**
```bash
# In Terminal 2:
cat > /Users/sivad/projects/credit-memo/TEST_RESULTS.txt << 'EOF'
TESTING COMPLETED: [Date/Time]

✅ Backend starts successfully
✅ Frontend loads with Ernie branding

"Credit analysts at banks spend 4-6 hours per loan manually:
- Copy-pasting from old memos
- Extracting data from PDFs by hand
- Calculating ratios in Excel
- Writing narrative analysis from scratch

This creates bottlenecks and delays loan decisions."

---

"Meet Ernie - your AI Credit Assistant for Midwest Regional Bank.

Ernie automates credit memo generation using:
- LandingAI's Agentic Document Extraction

3. **Narrate the workflow** using screenshots if needed

---

## DEMO SETUP CHECKLIST

**Before Demo:**
- [ ] Backend running on port 5001
- [ ] Frontend running on localhost:3000
- [ ] Tested "Test Data" button works (40 second flow)
- [ ] Browser window clean (close other tabs)
- [ ] Screen recording software ready (QuickTime/OBS)
- [ ] Backup slides/video ready
- [ ] Timer set for 4 minutes

**During Demo:**

- [ ] Point to specific features on screen
- [ ] Keep moving - don't get stuck on details
- [ ] Watch the clock - aim for 3:30-3:45

**What to Emphasize:**
1. LandingAI ADE integration (mandatory requirement)
2. Agentic workflow (not basic RAG)
3. Banking domain expertise
4. Production-ready features (audit trail, compliance)
5. Analyst empowerment (not replacement)

---

## KEY TALKING POINTS

**Problem Clarity:**
"Credit analysts waste hours on manual copy-paste work instead of analysis"

**Technical Depth:**
"Multi-agent architecture with LandingAI ADE, financial analysis, RAG retrieval, and LLM generation"

**Production Readiness:**
"Full audit trail, template-adaptive structure, bank-approved formatting"

**Business Value:**
"80% time reduction, faster loan decisions, consistent quality"

---

## QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT GET

**Q: How accurate is the extraction?**
A: "LandingAI ADE uses foundation models trained on documents. We validate with financial ratio reconciliation."

**Q: Do analysts trust AI-generated memos?**
A: "Ernie generates drafts for analyst review. All assertions include source citations. Analysts edit and approve."

**Q: What about hallucinations?**
A: "We ground every statement in extracted data with source references. RAG provides similar memo context. Analysts review everything."

**Q: How does this integrate with existing systems?**
A: "MVP is standalone. Production roadmap includes LOS integration, SharePoint connectors, and Office 365 export."

**Q: Is this just a RAG chatbot?**

- GitHub URL: ____________________________________
- Demo Video URL: ____________________________________

**Project Description (250 words max):**
```
Ernie is an intelligent credit analysis assistant that automates credit memo
generation for commercial bank loan underwriting. Credit analysts currently
spend 4-6 hours per loan manually copying data, calculating ratios, and
writing narratives from scratch. Ernie reduces this to 30 minutes by
intelligently extracting data, analyzing risk, and generating bank-approved
memo drafts.

Technical Architecture:
- LandingAI ADE API extracts 15+ financial fields from documents
- Multi-agent workflow with specialized financial analysis capabilities
- AWS Bedrock LLM generates narrative with RAG enhancement for context
- 9 key credit ratios calculated automatically with visual risk indicators
- Template-adaptive generation following "5 Cs of Credit" framework
- Professional bank branding with full audit trail for compliance

Key Differentiators:
- Agentic workflow, not basic RAG chatbot
- Banking domain expertise built-in
- Template-based generation with institutional formatting
- Source citations for every data point
- Analyst workflow (review/edit) rather than full automation

90-Day Pilot: Deploy with 3 analysts processing 50 loans to measure time
savings, quality consistency, and integration readiness with loan origination
systems.

Impact: 80% reduction in data entry time, consistent quality across analysts,
faster loan decisions for customers, full regulatory compliance with audit trail.
